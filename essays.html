    <p> <h1> <a name="barowskyessay"></a> <a target="_self" href="contributors.html#barowskybio"> Tabitha Barowsky </a> - “The Interior” </h1>
What happens when a story is so close to the truth, it could easily be confused for fact? Many modern-day works of fiction walk this line. Telling real stories through fictional characters creates a genre of fiction that not only teaches audiences but inspires a sort of self-reflection that could not have otherwise been reached. In Charles Yu’s 2020 novel Interior Chinatown, readers follow the life of Willis Wu as he works his way up the acting ladder from background actor to special guest star. 
    This essay, entitled "<a href="pdfs/Barowsky.pdf" download>The Interior</a>," argues that by examining the idea, or rather myth, of the model minority and how it is used within different works, one can see how it has affected its characters and the larger discussion as a whole, ultimately realizing just how much art has come to imitate real life.

    <h1><a name="pierreessay"></a> <a target="_self" href="contributors.html#pierrebio">Junior Pierre</a> - "Interior Chinatown Analysis" </h1>
    Stereotyping, hate crimes, and misrepresentation within the United States are all under the umbrella of racism. Some people might think these are the only forms of racism or that all racism must be explicit acts of abuse or violence. However, there are other “quieter” forms of racism that can sometimes be even more damaging than the obvious forms. Racism can form a sense of self-rejection and or self-hatred, all residing in forms of racism that might not be as openly apparent; these include internalized racism, intra-racial racism, and interracial racism. <a href="pdfs/Pierre.pdf" download>This research essay</a> explores how, in Charles Yu’s Interior Chinatown, Willis Wu experiences these other "quieter" forms of racism in his journey toward becoming more than the limitations that society placed on him, and that he in turn placed on himself.
